Welcome!
This is a personal project that I am making, aiming to code Minecraft with buttons.
Development will be slow, so please be patient.
Any issues or questions can be posted on the issues tab. I will try to answer as soon as possible.
Thanks guys!

**IMPORTANT**
**Pygame is required for this! The code will NOT work without pygame.
To install pygame, simply do pip install pygame, or if you are in a newer version of your OS, do pip3 install pygame in your terminal or command prompt.**
